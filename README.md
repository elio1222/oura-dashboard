This project exemplifies the boundaries of what a sleep dashboard looks like. This program uses the Oura API to fetch, store, visualize, and analyze my sleep data. This is my first 'full-stack' project using the following **tech stacks**:
  1. Frontend ~ HTML, CSS, JavaScript
  2. Backend ~ Flask (Python)
  3. Data Source ~ Oura Ring API
